# Demonstrator for OGC API Processes

The demonstrator should be started by the docker compose file of this project.

Afterwards, the demonstrator can be called via

`http://localhost:8888/ogc-api-demo/`

and should offer you an interface where you can select the different processes and trigger the requests by drawing geometries on the map.
